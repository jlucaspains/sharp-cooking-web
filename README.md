# Sharp Cooking Web
Sharp Cooking is a recipe book app originally created for iOS and Android using Xamarin platform. The original app repository is now public and available at [sharp-cooking](https://github.com/jlucaspains/sharp-cooking). However, the iOS and Android apps are no longer maintained and will be pulled from the app store in the near future.

This version of Sharp Cooking aims to provides the same features as the original app but as a installable web app (PWA) instead of native. In addition to the web app, a Python API is also provided for internal consumption only for recipe scraping.
